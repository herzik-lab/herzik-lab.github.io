# Hi, we're the Herzik Lab at UC San Diego
  We are part of the [Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://chemistry.ucsd.edu) at The University of California, San Diego.<br>

  Research in our lab focuses on elucidating the molecular underpinnings that govern
  acromolecular transport within eukaryotic cells. In particular, the lab employs
  innovative biophysical and structural methodologies, including electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM),
  to provide an atomic-level understanding of the structure and dynamics that govern these complex biological processes.

  We are located in the 4th floor of the Natural Sciences Building at UCSD.
