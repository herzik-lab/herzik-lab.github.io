      <p> The compartmentalization of cellular components into organelles is a critical aspect of normal eukaryotic physiology as numerous cellular processes are unable to proceed in the same environment. The process of sequestering reaction intermediates and signaling molecules into distinct microenvironments ensures these incompatible processes can proceed in their respective unique environments while also providing an additional level of regulation.</p>

      <p> The Herzik Lab strives to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing these processes using a combination of novel electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) methodologies, complementary biochemical and biophysical techniques, and innovative molecular modeling. The long term goal of these efforts is to provide an atomistic understanding of macromolecular transport within eukaryotic organelles.
